Text::Wrapper version 1.04, released May 25, 2012


    This module provides simple word wrapping.  It breaks long lines,
    but does not alter spacing or remove existing line breaks.  If
    you're looking for more sophisticated text formatting, try the
    Text::Format module.

    Reasons to use Text::Wrapper instead of Text::Format:

    *   Text::Wrapper is significantly smaller.

    *   It does not alter existing whitespace or combine short lines.
        It only breaks long lines.  By design, Text::Format removes
        all whitespace and then adds whitespace where it thinks
        appropriate.

    In short, Text::Wrapper is the object-oriented equivalent of
    Text::Wrap, but with fewer bugs (I hope).
